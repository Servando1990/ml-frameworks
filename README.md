# ML Frameworks

This repository contains two AI/ML frameworks developed by [Servando Torres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/servando-torres-239a26b0/):

1. **AI Prioritization Framework** - A strategic high-level framework for evaluating and prioritizing AI use cases based on impact and effort
2. **ML Implementation Framework** - A low-level framework specifically designed for ML teams to guide implementation

## AI Prioritization Framework

The AI Prioritization Framework helps organizations identify and prioritize AI initiatives by evaluating use cases based on their impact and effort. The framework visualizes use cases in a quadrant chart:

- **Quick Wins**: High Impact, Low Effort
- **Strategic Ventures**: High Impact, High Effort
- **Foundation Labs**: Low Impact, Low Effort
- **Optimization Zone**: Low Impact, High Effort

### Features

- Interactive quadrant chart visualization
- Use case management (add, edit, delete)
- Priority score calculation
- Implementation type tracking
- Secure logging system for submissions

### Live Demo

The AI Prioritization Framework is deployed at: [https://ai-framework-demo.vercel.app/](https://ai-framework-demo.vercel.app/)

## ML Implementation Framework

The ML Implementation Framework provides ML teams with a structured approach to implementing machine learning solutions, covering the entire ML lifecycle from data preparation to deployment and monitoring.

*Note: This framework is currently under development.*

## Deployment

### AI Prioritization Framework

The framework is deployed using Vercel. To deploy your own instance:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the ai-framework-demo directory
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod`

### Webflow Integration

Both frameworks can be integrated into a Webflow site:

1. Deploy the frameworks using Vercel or another hosting service
2. In Webflow, use an embed element to include the deployed application
3. Adjust the iframe settings as needed for proper display

## Development

To run the project locally:

```bash
# Navigate to the AI Prioritization Framework
cd ai-framework-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
