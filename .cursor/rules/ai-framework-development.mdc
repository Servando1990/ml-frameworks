- The framework allows users to:

- Key conventions:
A responsive layout
Dark/light theme support
Interactive components (forms, charts)
Social media integration
Modern design elements

- Core elements:
1. A Use Cases section
2. Impact/Effort Quadrants visualization
3. Use Case Scores table

Functionality

Add new use cases
Edit existing use cases
Delete use cases
Visualize use cases in an Impact/Effort matrix
See prioritized scores for each use case
Toggle example use cases

The quadrants are determined by:

Quick Wins: High Impact (≥5), Low Effort (<5)
Strategic Projects: High Impact (≥5), High Effort (≥5)
Fill Ins: Low Impact (<5), Low Effort (<5)
Maybes: Low Impact (<5), High Effort (≥5)

The use case scores are calculated:

Impact is weighted at 70% (0.7)
Effort is inverted (10 - effort) and weighted at 30% (0.3)
The final score is the sum of these two weighted values
